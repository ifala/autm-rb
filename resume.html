      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi folks! I'm Giacomo Falaschi, I'm a 32 year-old Tuscan guy, based in a very small town called Contea where, with some friends I funded a FabLab, perhaps the smallest one of Italy.
        I first got in touch with digital fabrication through the RepRap world, several years ago. Since then I have been experiencing various types of 3d printing and experimenting with different kinds of machines ad materials.  While doing this, I realized the importance of a collaboration between different knowledges and people: that's what brought me to fund a FabLab in my small town.
        Knowing that 3d printing is only one of the infinite possibilities to "create almost anything" I am here at the Fab Academy to improve my basic skills and learn lots of new things. Being familiar with mechanic movement, I look forward to make this knowledge interact with some less known (for me) areas, such as electronics and software design.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>While studyng computer programming at the University of Florence, I have been managing an e-learning platform for an important formative agency in Tuscany. After being employed in the national railways company (RFI), I moved to Rome where I've been working as a diagnostic railways technician, having the chance to improve some skills on inertial platforms, laser measurement systems, telecommunications...and a lot of team working!
        Thanks to this job I had the chance to live for 7 years with the guy who introduced me to the digital fabrication, Giuseppe Porsia (1984-2013). Also for not letting his memory and the projects we where thinking about together fade away, I decided to pursuit my experience in this area.</p>
      <p>links to projects will be added <a href="{{ "/projects" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">here</a>.</p>
