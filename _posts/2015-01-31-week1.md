# How to set-up ”jekill bootstrap markdown” site in android smartphone

****

###### During this week I haven't had access to my Macbook and I have been building my whole website on my Android smartphone. (Nexus 4 - android 4.4)

obviously I will redesign the template once I get back home.

> After setting up a ready made bootstrap-jekill-markdown web site as shown in/with [this tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/ )

and following the tutorial instruction to set up the name of the repository (where I forked the ready made site) with “myusername.guthub.io”
