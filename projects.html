    Here you are some sketches for my project

    I am really interested in creating a modular project and in experimenting with different harware interfacing with each other. My idea is to build a project made of different Lego-styled cubes, each of which is able to interact with the other similar units. 
    <img src="../../images/local/render1_low.jpg" />
    Each of these cubes will have 5 identical faces to connect with the other units, while the sixth face will twist on its own axes using a servo motor and reduction gears.
    <img src="../../images/local/render2_low.jpg" />
    On each of the 5 connecting faces, thare will be 4 Lego-styled pins connecting each unit to the others both mechanically and electronically. The whole object will be made of as many units as you wish and will serve as a twisting robotic arm, cubic snake or anything your hidden childish imagination can think about.

    On this page you can see some sketches made with SketchUp, but I will be using Solid Works or Rhino to design and build the final project.
